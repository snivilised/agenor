		// Decorate is used to wrap the existing client. The decoration will
		// result in the decorator being called first before the existing the
		// client. This needs to behave like chain of responsibility, because
		// the decorator has the choice of wether to pass on the call further
		// down the chain and ultimately the client's callback.
		// The returned bool indicates wether the next in the chain is invoked
		// or not; true, means pass on, false means absorb.
		//
		// A filter decorator will return true if the node matches filter, false
		// otherwise.
		// A fastward resume will act likewise. If we have fastward active, but
		// there is also an underlying filter we have a chain that looks like
		// this:
		// fastward-filter => underlying-filter => callback
		//
		// With this in place, we have to think very carefully as to whether we
		// really need a state machine, because the chain is able to fulfill this
		// purpose.
		//
		// but wait, let's think about wake and sleep. In the normal scenario,
		// fastward will start off in sleeping mode and the filter will be a
		// wake condition. Once we encounter the wake condition, the hibernation
		// decorator needs to be removed. But how do we know that the top of the
		// chain is the hibernate decorator? It must be that the resume hibernate
		// can't be decorated, this suggests some kind of priority/authorisation
		// is required. Because of this, we need a role and we also need to make
		// sure the features are initialised in the correct order to make this
		// happen correctly => sequence manifest
		//
		// role indicates the guise under which the decorator is being applied.
		// Not all roles can be decorated. The fastward-resume decorator can
		// not be decorated. If an attempt is made to Decorate a sealed decorator,
		// an error is returned.
