## üî∞ Introduction

This project provides a directory walker in the same vein as the ___Walk___ in standard library ___filepath___, but provides many features in addition to the basic facility of simply navigating. These include, but not limited to the following:

- Comprehensive filtering with regex/glob patterns
- Resume, from a previous navigation that was prematurely terminated (typically via a ctrl-c interrupt), or cancellation via a context; this is particularly useful if the client program runs heavy IO bound tasks resulting in relatively long batch runs
- Hibernation, this allows for client defined action to be invoked for eligible file/folders encountered during navigation, when a particular condition occurs; as opposed to invoking the client action for every file/folder from the root onwards. The navigator starts off in a hibernated state, then when the condition occurs, the navigator awakens and begins invoking the client action for eligible nodes.
- Concurrent navigation implemented with a reactive model, using rx observables
- Compatibility with ___os.fs___ file system
- Ability to hook many aspects of the traversal process

</p>

- unit testing with [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/)/[Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/)
- implemented with [üêç Cobra](https://cobra.dev/) cli framework, assisted by [üê≤ Cobrass](https://github.com/snivilised/cobrass)
- i18n with [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n)
- linting configuration and pre-commit hooks, (see: [linting-golang](https://freshman.tech/linting-golang/)).
- uses [üí• lo](https://github.com/samber/lo)

### üåê l10n Translations

This template has been setup to support localisation. The default language is `en-GB` with support for `en-US`. There is a translation file for `en-US` defined as __src/i18n/deploy/astrolib.active.en-US.json__. This is the initial translation for `en-US` that should be deployed with the app.

Make sure that the go-i18n package has been installed so that it can be invoked as cli, see [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) for installation instructions.

To maintain localisation of the application, the user must take care to implement all steps to ensure translate-ability of all user facing messages. Whenever there is a need to add/change user facing messages including error messages, to maintain this state, the user must:

- define template struct (__xxxTemplData__) in __src/i18n/messages.go__ and corresponding __Message()__ method. All messages are defined here in the same location, simplifying the message extraction process as all extractable strings occur at the same place. Please see [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) for all translation/pluralisation options and other regional sensitive content.

For more detailed workflow instructions relating to i18n, please see [i18n README](./resources/doc/i18n-README.md)
